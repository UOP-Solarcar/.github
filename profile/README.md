## Who are we

The Pacific Solar Car Project aims to race in the summer 2024 American Solar Challenge (ASC) to improve technologies for sustainable energy at low cost. Together, we are forming a space for project-based learning and hands-on experience for ALL University of the Pacific students and interested persons.

We are dedicated to promoting overlooked, essential businesses that make our project possible. Simultaneously, we hope to enrich opportunities for individuals, students, and families in the Stockton community.
